get5
===========================

[![Build status](http://ci.splewis.net/job/get5/badge/icon)](http://ci.splewis.net/job/get5/)

Get5 is a [SourceMod](http://www.sourcemod.net/) plugin for CS:GO servers for running matches. It is originally based on [pugsetup](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-pug-setup) and is inspired by [eBot](https://github.com/deStrO/eBot-CSGO).

The core idea behind its use is all match details being fully defined in a single config file. Check out [this example config](configs/get5/example_match.cfg). Its main target use-case is tournaments (online or LAN). All that is required of the server-admins is to load match config file to the server and the match should run without any more manual actions from the admins. This plugin is not invasive - most of its functionality is built to work within how the CS:GO server normally operates, not replacing its functionality.

Features of this include:
- Locking players to the correct team by their Steam ID
- In-game map veto support from the match's maplist
- Support for multi-map series (Bo1, Bo3, Bo5, etc.)
- Warmup and !ready system each team
- Automatic GOTV demo recording
- Knifing for sides
- Pausing support
- Coaching support
- Automatically executing match config files
- Automatically setting team names/logos/match text values for spectator/GOTV clients

#### TODO:

This is still very-much a work in progress. It may have bugs. See the [issues](https://github.com/splewis/get5/issues) section for bugs or things that are yet-to-be-done. Pull requests are welcome.


## Download and Installation

#### Requirements
You must have sourcemod installed on the game server. You can download it at http://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php. Note that sourcemod also requires MetaMod:Source to be on the server. You can download it at http://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.

#### Download
Download a release package from the [releases section](https://github.com/splewis/get5/releases) or a [the latest development build](http://ci.splewis.net/job/get5/lastSuccessfulBuild/).

#### Installation
Extract the download archive into the csgo/ directory on the server. The only required file is actually just the ``get5.smx`` plugin binary in the ``addons/sourcemod/plugins`` directory. The example configs and plugin source code do not have to be uploaded.


## Commands
#### Client Commands
- ``!ready``: marks a client's team as ready to begin
- ``!unready``: marks a client's team as not-ready
- ``!pause``: requests a freezetime pause
- ``!unpause``: requests an unpause
- ``!coach``: moves a client to coach for their team
- ``!stay``: elects to stay after a knife round win
- ``!swap``: elects to swap after a knife round win

#### Server Commands
- ``get5_loadmatch``: loads a match config file (JSON or keyvalues) relative from the ``csgo`` directory
- ``get5_loadmatch_url``: loads a remote (JSON formatted) match config by sending a HTTP GET to the given url, this requires either the [system2](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=146019) or [Steamworks](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=229556) Extensions
- ``get5_endmatch``: force ends the current match
- ``get5_status``: replies with JSON formatted match state (also available to clients)
- ``get5_creatematch``: creates a Bo1 match with the current players on the server on the current map
- ``get5_addplayer``: adds a steamid to a team
- ``get5_removeplayer``: removes a steamid from all teams


## Match Schema

See the example config in [Vavle KeyValues format](configs/get5/example_match.cfg) or [JSON format](configs/get5/example_match.json) to learn how to format the configs. Both files contain equivalent match data.

**Note:** to use a JSON match file, you must install the [SMJansson](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=184604) sourcemod extension on the server.

- ``matchid``: a string matchid used to identify the match
- ``maps_to_win``: number of maps needed to win the series (1 in a Bo1, 2 in a Bo3, 3 in a Bo5)
- ``maplist``: list of the maps in use (an array of strings in JSON, mapnames as keys for KeyValues)
- ``skip_veto``: whether the veto will be skipped and the maps will come from the maplist (in the order given)
- ``side_type``: either "standard", "never_knife", or "always_knife"; standard means the team that doesn't pick a map gets the side choice, never_knife means team is always on CT first, and always knife means there is always a knife round
- ``players_per_team``: maximum players per team (doesn't include a coach spot)
- ``favored_percentage_team1``: wrapper for ``mp_teamprediction_pct``
- ``favored_percentage_text`` wrapper for ``mp_teamprediction_txt``
- ``cvars``: cvars to be set during the match warmup/knife round/live state
- ``spectators``: see the team schema below (only the ``players`` section is used for spectators)
- ``team1``: see the team schema below
- ``team2``: see the team schema below

#### Team Schema
- ``name``: team name (wraps ``mp_teamname_1`` and is displayed often in chat messages)
- ``flag``: team flag (2 letter country code, wraps ``mp_teamflag_1``)
- ``logo`` team logo (wraps ``mp_teamlogo_1``)
- ``matchtext``: warps ``mp_teammatchstat_txt``
- ``players``: list of Steam2 id's for users on the team

## ConVars
Note: these are auto-executed on plugin start by the auto-generated (the 1st time the plugin starts) file ``cfg/sourcemod/get5.cfg``.

You should either set these in the above file, or in the match config's ``cvars`` section.

- ``get5_autoload_config``: a config file to autoload on map starts if no match is loaded
- ``get5_demo_name_format``: format to name demo files in (default ``{MATCHID}_map{MAPNUMBER}_{MAPNAME}``)
- ``get5_kick_when_no_match_loaded``: whether to kick all clients if no match is loaded
- ``get5_pausing_enabled``: whether pausing (!pause command) is enabled
- ``get5_time_format``: time format string (default ``"%Y-%m-%d_%H``), only affects if a {TIME} tag is used in ``get5_demo_name_format``
- ``get5_wait_for_spec_ready``: whether to wait for spectators (if there are any) to ready up to begin
- ``get5_warmup_cfg``": config file executed in warmup periods
- ``get5_live_cfg``: config file executed when the game goes live
