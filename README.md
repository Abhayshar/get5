get5
===========================

[![Build status](http://ci.splewis.net/job/get5/badge/icon)](http://ci.splewis.net/job/get5/)

Get5 is a [SourceMod](http://www.sourcemod.net/) plugin for CS:GO servers for running matches. It is originally based on [pugsetup](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-pug-setup) and is inspired by [eBot](https://github.com/deStrO/eBot-CSGO).

The core idea behind its use is all match details being fully defined in a single config file. Check out [this example config](configs/get5/example_match.cfg). Its main target use-case is tournaments (online or LAN). All that is required of the server-admins is to load match config file to the server and the match should run without any more manual actions from the admins. This plugin is not invasive - most of its functionality is built to work within how the CS:GO server normally operates, not replacing its functionality.

Features of this include:
- Locking players to the correct team by their Steam ID
- In-game map veto support from the match's maplist
- Support for multi-map series (Bo1, Bo3, Bo5, etc.)
- Warmup and !ready system each team
- Automatic GOTV demo recording
- Knifing for sides
- Pausing support
- Coaching support
- Automatically executing match config files
- Automatically setting team names/logos/match text values for spectator/GOTV clients

## Download and Installation

#### Requirements
You must have sourcemod installed on the game server. You can download it at http://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php. Note that sourcemod also requires MetaMod:Source to be on the server. You can download it at http://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.

#### Download
Download a release package from the [releases section](https://github.com/splewis/get5/releases) or a [the latest development build](http://ci.splewis.net/job/get5/lastSuccessfulBuild/).

#### Installation
Extract the download archive into the csgo/ directory on the server. The only required file is actually just the ``get5.smx`` plugin binary in the ``addons/sourcemod/plugins`` directory. The example configs and plugin source code do not have to be uploaded.
